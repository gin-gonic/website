```go
func main() {
	// Creates a router without any middleware by default
	r := gin.New()

	// Global middleware
	// Logger middleware will write the logs to gin.DefaultWriter even if you set with GIN_MODE=release.
	// By default gin.DefaultWriter = os.Stdout
	router.Use(gin.Logger())

	// Recovery middleware recovers from any panics and writes a 500 if there was one.
	router.Use(gin.Recovery())

	// Per route middleware, you can add as many as you desire.
	router.GET("/benchmark", MyBenchLogger(), benchEndpoint)

	// Authorization group
	// authorized := router.Group("/", AuthRequired())
	// exactly the same as:
	authorized := router.Group("/")
	// per group middleware! in this case we use the custom created
	// AuthRequired() middleware just in the "authorized" group.
	authorized.Use(AuthRequired())
	{
		authorized.POST("/login", loginEndpoint)
		authorized.POST("/submit", submitEndpoint)
		authorized.POST("/read", readEndpoint)

		// nested group
		testing := authorized.Group("testing")
		testing.GET("/analytics", analyticsEndpoint)
	}

	// Listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080
	router.Run(":8080")
}
```
