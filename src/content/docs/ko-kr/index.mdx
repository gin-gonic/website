## What is Gin?

Gin is a web framework written in Golang. It features a martini-like API with much better performance, up to 40 times faster. If you need performance and good productivity, you will love Gin.

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Fast" icon="rocket">
		Radix tree based routing, small memory foot print. No reflection. Predictable API performance.
	</Card>
	<Card icon="seti:plan" title="Middleware support">
		A incoming HTTP request can be handled by a chain of middlewares and the final action. For example: Logger, Authorization, GZIP and finally post a message in the DB.
	</Card>
	<Card icon="seti:lock" title="Crash-free">
		Gin can catch a panic occurred during a HTTP request and recover it. This way, your server will be always available. It’s also possible to report this panic to Sentry for example!
	</Card>
	<Card icon="approve-check-circle" title="JSON validation">
		Gin can parse and validate the JSON of a request, checking for example the existence of required values.
	</Card>
	<Card icon="puzzle" title="Routes grouping">
		Organize your routes better. Authorization required vs non required, different API versions. In addition, the groups can be nested unlimitedly without degrading performance.
	</Card>
	<Card iconicon="open-book" title="Error management">
		Gin provides a convenient way to collect all the errors occurred during a HTTP request. Eventually, a middleware can write them to a log file, to a database and send them through the network.
	</Card>
	<Card icon="seti:json" title="Rendering built-in">
		Gin provides an easy to use API for JSON, XML and HTML rendering.
	</Card>
	<Card icon="seti:html" title="Extendable">
		Creating a new middleware is so easy, just check out the sample codes.
	</Card>
