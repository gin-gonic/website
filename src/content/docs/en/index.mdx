## What is Gin?

Gin is a web framework written in Golang. It features a Martini-like API, but with performance up to 40 times faster than Martini. If you need performance and productivity, you will love Gin.

	<Card title="Fast" icon="rocket">
		Radix tree based routing, small memory foot print. No reflection. Predictable API performance.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Middleware support" icon="seti:plan">
		An incoming HTTP request can be handled by a chain of middleware and the final action. For example: Logger, Authorization, GZIP and finally post a message in the DB.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Crash-free" icon="seti:lock">
		Gin can catch a panic occurred during a HTTP request and recover it. This way, your server will be always available. Itâ€™s also possible to report this panic to Sentry for example!
	</Card>
	<Card title="JSON validation" icon="approve-check-circle">
		Gin can parse and validate the JSON of a request, checking, for example, the existence of required values.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Routes grouping" icon="puzzle">
		Organize your routes better. Authorization required vs non required, different API versions. In addition, groups can be nested infinitely without degrading performance.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Error management" icon="open-book">
		Gin provides a convenient way to collect all the errors occurred during a HTTP request. Eventually, middleware can write them to a log file, to a database and send them through the network.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Rendering built-in" icon="seti:json">
		Gin provides an easy to use API for JSON, XML and HTML rendering.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Extendable" icon="seti:html">
		Creating new middleware is so easy, just check out the sample code.
	</Card>
