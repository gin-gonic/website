**What is Gin?**

Gin is a web framework written in Golang. It features a Martini-like API, but
with performance up to 40 times faster than Martini. If you need performance and
productivity, you will love Gin.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-tachometer-alt" title="Fast" %}}

Radix tree based routing, small memory foot print. No reflection. Predictable
API performance.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-bars" title="Middleware support"%}}

An incoming HTTP request can be handled by a chain of middleware and the final
action. For example: Logger, Authorization, GZIP and finally post a message in
the DB.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-life-ring" title="Crash-free"  %}}

Gin can catch a panic occurred during a HTTP request and recover it. This way,
your server will be always available. Itâ€™s also possible to report this panic to
Sentry for example! {{% /blocks/feature %}}

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-check-circle" title="JSON validation" %}}

Gin can parse and validate the JSON of a request, checking, for example, the
existence of required values.

Organize your routes better. Authorization required vs non required, different
API versions. In addition, groups can be nested infinitely without degrading
performance.

{{% blocks/feature icon="fa-briefcase" title="Error management"  %}}

Gin provides a convenient way to collect all the errors occurred during a HTTP
request. Eventually, middleware can write them to a log file, to a database and
send them through the network.
