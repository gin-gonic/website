## [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)

GAE has two ways to deploy Go applications. The standard environment is easier to use but less customizable and prevents [syscalls](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/1639) for security reasons. The flexible environment can run any framework or library.
