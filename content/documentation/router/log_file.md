By changing the `gin.DefaultWriter` field you can redirect the logs somewhere
different from the terminal. Here is an example on how to write the logs to a file.

```go
func main() {
	// Disable Console Color, you don't need console color when writing the logs to file.
	gin.DisableConsoleColor()

	// Logging to a file.
	f, _ := os.Create("gin.log")
	gin.DefaultWriter = io.MultiWriter(f)

	// Use the following code if you need to write the logs to file and console at the same time.
	// gin.DefaultWriter = io.MultiWriter(f, os.Stdout)

	router := gin.Default()
	router.GET("/ping", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.String(200, "pong")
	})

	router.Run(":8080")
}
```
