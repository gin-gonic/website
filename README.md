# Gin website

[![Run Deploy](https://github.com/gin-gonic/website/actions/workflows/node.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gin-gonic/website/actions/workflows/node.yml)

Welcome! This repository houses all the assets required to build the Gin website and documentation. We're pleased that you want to contribute! The website is hosted at https://gin-gonic.com.

We use [Astro](https://astro.build) to format and generate our website, the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) template for styling and site structure. Thanks!.

## Running

See the [official Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started) for Astro installation instructions. and [Starlight documentation](https://starlight.astro.build/getting-started) for Starlight installation instructions.

To run the site locally when you have Hugo installed:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start the local Astro server on port 4321. Open up your browser to http://localhost:4321 to view the site. As you make changes to the source files, Astro updates the site and forces a browser refresh.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
