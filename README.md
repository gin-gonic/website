Once your pull request is created, a Gin reviewer will take responsibility for providing clear, actionable feedback, re-improve and merge.

## Running

See the [official Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for Hugo installation instructions.

To run the site locally when you have Hugo installed:

```sh
$ hugo
$ hugo server
```

This will start the local Hugo server on port 1313. Open up your browser to http://localhost:1313 to view the site. As you make changes to the source files, Hugo updates the site and forces a browser refresh.

## Thanks

Gin thrives on community participation, and we really appreciate your contributions to our site and our documentation!

> The website build based on [opencensus-website](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-website), thanks!
